> Coffees from this region - particularly around Hawata Washing Station - are some of the highest grown coffees in Ethiopia with some farms topping out at 2300m. This particular lot is a mix between forest grown and semi-forest grown coffees.
>
> In a semi-forest arrangement, growers own the land beneath the canopy and may grow complementary crops to supplement income, while forest coffee refers to naturally growing coffee trees in government protected forest reserves where harvesting is permitted, but planting is forbidden. Shade-grown coffee plantations do a better job of maintaining natural biodiversity and complex habitats.

The packaging from the roaster is always asthetically pleasing. The coffee bean info are printed onto a separate thick card using letterpress printing, which is a great design choiceÔºÅI believe these beautiful details are the organic part of the whole coffee brewing experience :).

01/21: I tasted a little bit floral notes, but not too much tart, citrusy notes as I expected. It felt more earthy and nutty to me, but I am not someone with a sensitive tongue. I used 4+1 grind level + 205F this time, so maybe next time I will try a little bit courser grind, and higher temperature to see whether I can extract more flavors.
