It is very fruity, maybe the most fruity one among all the coffee I've had in my life. I felt like I was drinking grapefruit juice at the first sip. A perfect coffee for summer time. I tried making a tonic mixing black sugar, double shot espresso made using the bean, and sparkling water. It was awesome! I feel like it will work well as any kind of sweetened, cold drinks.
